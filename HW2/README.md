# RISC vs CISC

In this homework, you are asked to prepare a report about RISC and CISC. Your report should answer the following questions and it should not exceed 2 pages. Your report should be in the format of academic writing and all the references should be included at the end of your file.

Questions: 

-	What is the historical evaluation of RISC and CISC. Which one was proposed first?

-	Compare RISC and CISC in terms of the following aspects. Also give examples for each aspect from MIPS and X86 architectures.

    - Number and types of instructions in them

    - Addressing Modes

    - Data Types

    - Memory Organization

    - Registers

    - Virtual Memory Support 

-	Which one is better, RISC or CISC? What are the benefits in each computer? For instance, for which computer compiler’s/hardware’s job is easier? 

-	What is the translation layer in X86 architecture?
